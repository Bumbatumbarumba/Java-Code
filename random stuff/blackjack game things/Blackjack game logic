Blackjack game logic

-everyone gets two cards
-in order, see who wants to hit
--> hit if sum < 21
--> passing (ie, not hitting) is rng
--> NEVER hit on 21
----> the closer the sum is to 21, the lower the likelihood
--> dealer hits until they get 17***
----> dealer will always be the last person in the list of players
